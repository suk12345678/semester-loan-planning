            <h2>Why Four-Year Planning Matters</h2>
            <p>Most students think semester-by-semester. But your loans compound over time.</p>
            <p>What you borrow freshman year accrues interest for 4+ years before you even start repaying.</p>
            <p>Planning ahead helps you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stay under your target total debt</li>
                <li>Minimize interest accrual</li>
                <li>Make informed decisions each semester</li>
                <li>Avoid surprises at graduation</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Federal Loan Limits</h2>
            <p>There are annual and aggregate (total) limits on how much you can borrow.</p>

            <h3>Annual Limits for Dependent Undergraduates</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Freshman year:</strong> $5,500 (max $3,500 subsidized)</li>
                <li><strong>Sophomore year:</strong> $6,500 (max $4,500 subsidized)</li>
                <li><strong>Junior year:</strong> $7,500 (max $5,500 subsidized)</li>
                <li><strong>Senior year:</strong> $7,500 (max $5,500 subsidized)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Aggregate Limit</h3>
            <p>Total for undergraduate: <strong>$31,000</strong> (max $23,000 subsidized)</p>

            <h3>Independent Students</h3>
            <p>If you're independent (24+, married, have dependents, etc.), you can borrow an additional $4,000-$5,000 per year in unsubsidized loans.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>What This Means</h3>
                <p>If you max out federal loans all four years, you'll graduate with $27,000-$31,000 in debt.</p>
                <p>That's before any Parent PLUS or private loans.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Creating Your Four-Year Plan</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: Estimate Total Cost</h3>
            <p>What will four years cost?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuition and fees × 8 semesters</li>
                <li>Housing × 8 semesters</li>
                <li>Meal plan × 8 semesters</li>
                <li>Books and supplies × 8 semesters</li>
                <li>Other expenses × 8 semesters</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: Estimate Total Resources</h3>
            <p>What funding will you have?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scholarships and grants (renewable?)</li>
                <li>Family contribution</li>
                <li>Work-study or part-time job earnings</li>
                <li>Savings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Calculate Total Borrowing Need</h3>
            <p><strong>Total Cost - Total Resources = Total Loans Needed</strong></p>

            <h3>Step 4: Divide by 8 Semesters</h3>
            <p>This gives you a target per-semester borrowing amount.</p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>Total 4-year cost: $80,000</p>
                <p>Total resources: $40,000</p>
                <p>Total loans needed: $40,000</p>
                <p>Per semester: $5,000</p>
                <p>If you're borrowing more than $5,000 per semester, you'll exceed your target. Adjust expenses or find more funding.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Things That Change Over Four Years</h2>

            <h3>Tuition Increases</h3>
            <p>Most schools raise tuition 3-5% per year. Factor this in.</p>

            <h3>Scholarship Renewals</h3>
            <p>Some scholarships are one-year only. Know which ones renew and which don't.</p>

            <h3>Dependency Status</h3>
            <p>If you turn 24, get married, or have a child, you become independent and can borrow more.</p>

            <h3>Housing Changes</h3>
            <p>Moving off-campus might be cheaper or more expensive. Plan accordingly.</p>

            <h3>Income Changes</h3>
            <p>You might get better-paying jobs as you gain experience. This can reduce borrowing need.</p>

            <h2>Summer Semester Considerations</h2>
            <p>Summer is tricky. Some schools treat it as part of the previous academic year, others as part of the next.</p>

            <h3>If You Take Summer Classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You may be eligible for loans</li>
                <li>But it might reduce your fall/spring loan amounts</li>
                <li>Check with your financial aid office</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If You Don't Take Summer Classes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>You won't have loan money for summer living expenses</li>
                <li>Plan to work or save during the school year</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Tracking Your Progress</h2>

            <h3>Every Semester, Check:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>How much have I borrowed so far?</li>
                <li>How much interest has accrued?</li>
                <li>Am I on track with my four-year plan?</li>
                <li>Do I need to adjust my borrowing or expenses?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Use StudentAid.gov</h3>
            <p>Log in to see all your federal loans, balances, and interest rates.</p>

            <h2>Strategies to Reduce Total Debt</h2>

            <h3>1. Graduate Early</h3>
            <p>Take extra credits, summer classes, or AP/CLEP exams to finish in 3-3.5 years.</p>

            <h3>2. Start at Community College</h3>
            <p>Complete general education requirements at a cheaper school, then transfer.</p>

            <h3>3. Work More, Borrow Less</h3>
            <p>Increase work hours during school or take a semester off to work and save.</p>

            <h3>4. Apply for Scholarships Every Semester</h3>
            <p>Don't stop after freshman year. Keep applying.</p>

            <h3>5. Reduce Living Expenses</h3>
            <p>Cheaper housing, cook at home, minimize discretionary spending.</p>

            <h3>6. Pay Interest While in School</h3>
            <p>Even $50/month on unsubsidized loans reduces your total debt.</p>

            <h2>What If You're Off Track?</h2>
            <p>If you're borrowing more than planned:</p>

            <h3>Reassess Your Plan</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you reduce expenses?</li>
                <li>Can you increase income?</li>
                <li>Should you transfer to a cheaper school?</li>
                <li>Should you take a semester off to work?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Don't Ignore It</h3>
            <p>The problem won't fix itself. The earlier you adjust, the better.</p>

            <h2>Graduating with a Plan</h2>
            <p>By senior year, you should know:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your exact total debt</li>
                <li>Your monthly payment amount</li>
                <li>Which repayment plan you'll use</li>
                <li>Whether your expected salary can cover it</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The 80% Rule Revisited</h2>
            <p>Your total student loan debt should not exceed 80% of your expected first-year salary.</p>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>Examples</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Expected salary: $40,000 → Max debt: $32,000</li>
                    <li>Expected salary: $50,000 → Max debt: $40,000</li>
                    <li>Expected salary: $60,000 → Max debt: $48,000</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you're exceeding this, you may struggle with repayment.</p>
