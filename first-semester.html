            <p class="subtitle">What to expect when borrowing for the first time</p>
        </header>

        <section class="content">
            <h2>First-Time Borrower Requirements</h2>
            <p>Before your first federal student loan can be disbursed, you must complete two things:</p>

            <h3>1. Entrance Counseling</h3>
            <p>This is a mandatory online session that explains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What you're agreeing to</li>
                <li>How interest works</li>
                <li>Your repayment obligations</li>
                <li>Your rights and responsibilities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It takes about 30 minutes. Do it at <a href="https://studentaid.gov" target="_blank">StudentAid.gov</a>.</p>

            <h3>2. Master Promissory Note (MPN)</h3>
            <p>This is the legal document where you promise to repay your loans.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>One MPN covers all your Direct Loans for up to 10 years</li>
                <li>You only sign it once (unless you change schools)</li>
                <li>Also completed at StudentAid.gov</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Do This Early</h3>
                <p>Don't wait until the last minute. If you don't complete entrance counseling and the MPN, your loan won't disburse, and you'll have a gap in funding.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>The 30-Day Delay</h2>
            <p>If this is your very first federal student loan, there's a mandatory waiting period:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your first disbursement cannot happen until <strong>30 days after your enrollment period begins</strong></li>
                <li>This is a federal requirement to give you time to reconsider</li>
                <li>It only applies to your first loan everâ€”not every year</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What This Means</h3>
            <p>If classes start August 20:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Your first disbursement can't happen before September 19</li>
                <li>You'll need to cover expenses for the first month from other sources</li>
                <li>Plan ahead for books, housing deposits, meal plans, etc.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Much Should You Borrow?</h2>
            <p>Your first semester sets the pattern. Borrow smart from the start.</p>

            <h3>Calculate Your Actual Need</h3>
            <p><strong>Costs:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuition and fees: $______</li>
                <li>Housing: $______</li>
                <li>Meal plan: $______</li>
                <li>Books and supplies: $______</li>
                <li>Transportation: $______</li>
                <li>Personal expenses: $______</li>
                <li><strong>Total: $______</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Resources:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scholarships/grants: $______</li>
                <li>Family contribution: $______</li>
                <li>Work-study/job: $______</li>
                <li>Savings: $______</li>
                <li><strong>Total: $______</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Gap to borrow: $______</strong></p>

            <h2>Subsidized vs Unsubsidized</h2>
            <p>You'll likely be offered both types. Here's the difference:</p>

            <h3>Subsidized Loans</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Based on financial need</li>
                <li>Government pays interest while you're in school</li>
                <li>Lower annual limits</li>
                <li><strong>Always take these first</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Unsubsidized Loans</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Not based on need</li>
                <li>Interest accrues from day one</li>
                <li>Higher annual limits</li>
                <li><strong>Only take if you need more than subsidized covers</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your First Disbursement</h2>

            <h3>When It Happens</h3>
            <p>Typically within the first 10 days of the semester (plus the 30-day delay for first-time borrowers).</p>

            <h3>Where It Goes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Directly to your school</li>
                <li>School applies it to tuition and fees</li>
                <li>Then to housing and meal plan (if applicable)</li>
                <li>Leftover amount is refunded to you</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Getting Your Refund</h3>
            <p>Set up direct deposit in your student portal. It's much faster than waiting for a paper check.</p>

            <h2>Common First-Semester Mistakes</h2>

            <h3>1. Not Completing Requirements on Time</h3>
            <p>Missing entrance counseling or MPN deadlines delays your disbursement.</p>

            <h3>2. Accepting the Full Amount Without Thinking</h3>
            <p>You can reduce your loan amount. Don't borrow more than you need.</p>

            <h3>3. Spending Refunds on Non-Essentials</h3>
            <p>That refund is borrowed money. Use it for education expenses only.</p>

            <h3>4. Not Tracking What You Borrowed</h3>
            <p>Write down how much you borrowed. You'll need to know this for future planning.</p>

            <h3>5. Ignoring Interest Accrual</h3>
            <p>If you have unsubsidized loans, interest is accruing right now. Even small payments help.</p>

            <h2>Setting Yourself Up for Success</h2>

            <h3>Create a Budget</h3>
            <p>Track every dollar. Know where your money is going.</p>

            <h3>Look for Ways to Reduce Costs</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Buy used textbooks or rent them</li>
                <li>Cook instead of eating out</li>
                <li>Use free campus resources</li>
                <li>Avoid unnecessary purchases</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Consider Working Part-Time</h3>
            <p>Even 10 hours a week can reduce how much you need to borrow.</p>

            <h3>Apply for Scholarships</h3>
            <p>Keep applying every semester. Small scholarships add up.</p>

            <h2>What to Expect Next Semester</h2>
            <p>Good news: Future semesters are easier.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No 30-day delay (that's only for first-time borrowers)</li>
                <li>MPN is already signed (covers you for 10 years)</li>
                <li>You know what to expect</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But you'll still need to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accept or reduce your loan amount each semester</li>
                <li>Track your total debt</li>
                <li>Make smart borrowing decisions</li>
            </ul>
