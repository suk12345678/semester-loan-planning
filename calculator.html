            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Estimated cost per semester (tuition, housing, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Scholarships and grants per semester</li>
                    <li>Expected family contribution</li>

                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Scenarios You Can Model</h2>

            <h3>Before You Start College</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What if I go to School A vs School B?</li>
                <li>What if I live on-campus vs off-campus?</li>
                <li>What if I work 10 hours/week vs 20 hours/week?</li>
                <li>What if I graduate in 3 years vs 4 years?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During College</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Am I on track with my borrowing plan?</li>
                <li>What if I reduce my loan amount this semester?</li>
                <li>What if I pay interest while in school?</li>
                <li>Should I take summer classes or work full-time?</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Planning for Graduation</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>What will my monthly payment be?</li>
                <li>Can I afford it on my expected salary?</li>
                <li>Should I pursue income-driven repayment?</li>
                <li>How much faster can I pay it off with extra payments?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Visualizing Interest Accrual</h2>
            <p>The calculator shows you how interest grows over time:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freshman year loans accrue interest for 4+ years before repayment</li>
                <li>Senior year loans only accrue for 6 months before repayment</li>
                <li>This is why borrowing less early on saves more money</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>$5,000 borrowed freshman year at 5% interest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interest during 4 years of school: ~$1,000</li>
                    <li>If capitalized, you'll pay interest on that $1,000 too</li>
                </ul>
                <p>$5,000 borrowed senior year at 5% interest:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interest during 6-month grace period: ~$125</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Same amount borrowed, but freshman year loan costs 8× more in accrued interest</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>Comparing Different Paths</h2>
            <p>Use the calculator to compare:</p>

            <h3>Path 1: Four-Year University</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$80,000 total cost</li>
                <li>$40,000 in loans</li>
                <li>Graduate in 4 years</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Path 2: Community College + Transfer</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$50,000 total cost</li>
                <li>$20,000 in loans</li>
                <li>Graduate in 4 years</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Path 3: Work Part-Time Throughout</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>$80,000 total cost</li>
                <li>$25,000 in loans (work covers the rest)</li>
                <li>Graduate in 4.5 years</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Which path makes the most sense for you?</p>

            <h2>The 80% Rule Calculator</h2>
            <p>The calculator automatically checks if your total debt exceeds 80% of your expected salary.</p>

            <h3>Green Zone</h3>
            <p>Total debt is less than 80% of expected salary. You should be able to manage repayment comfortably.</p>

            <h3>Yellow Zone</h3>
            <p>Total debt is 80-100% of expected salary. Repayment will be tight but manageable.</p>

            <h3>Red Zone</h3>
            <p>Total debt exceeds 100% of expected salary. You may struggle with repayment. Consider reducing costs or increasing expected income.</p>

            <h2>Adjusting Your Plan</h2>
            <p>If the calculator shows you're borrowing too much, try:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reducing housing costs</li>
                <li>Increasing work hours</li>
                <li>Applying for more scholarships</li>
                <li>Choosing a less expensive school</li>
                <li>Graduating early</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The calculator lets you adjust these variables in real-time to see the impact.</p>
