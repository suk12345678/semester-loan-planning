            <h2>The Problem with "Just Accept the Full Amount"</h2>
            <p>Every semester, you get a financial aid offer. It includes loans. And most students just accept the full amount without thinking.</p>
            <p>Four years later, they graduate with $40,000 in debt and wonder how it happened.</p>

            <h2>Why Semester Planning Matters</h2>
            <p>Student loans aren't a one-time decision. You borrow multiple times over multiple years.</p>
            <p>Each semester is a chance to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Borrow only what you actually need</li>
                <li>Avoid over-borrowing</li>
                <li>Minimize interest</li>
                <li>Stay on track with your total debt</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout">
                <h3>The Compounding Effect</h3>
                <p>If you over-borrow by $1,000 each semester for 8 semesters, that's $8,000 in unnecessary debt.</p>
                <p>At 5% interest over 10 years, that $8,000 costs you an extra $10,200 total.</p>
                <p><strong>Small decisions compound.</strong></p>
            </div>

            <h2>How to Calculate What You Actually Need</h2>

            <h3>Step 1: List Your Costs</h3>
            <p>For the upcoming semester, what will you actually spend?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuition and fees (after scholarships/grants)</li>
                <li>Housing (dorm or rent)</li>
                <li>Meal plan or groceries</li>
                <li>Books and supplies</li>
                <li>Transportation</li>
                <li>Personal expenses</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 2: List Your Resources</h3>
            <p>What money do you have coming in?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scholarships and grants</li>
                <li>Family contribution</li>
                <li>Work-study or part-time job</li>
                <li>Savings</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Calculate the Gap</h3>
            <p><strong>Total Costs - Total Resources = Amount to Borrow</strong></p>
            <p>This is your actual need, not the maximum you're offered.</p>

            <h2>Common Over-Borrowing Traps</h2>

            <h3>1. Accepting the Full Offer</h3>
            <p>Your financial aid office offers you the maximum you're eligible for, not the minimum you need.</p>
            <p>You can (and should) reduce the amount.</p>

            <h3>2. Using Loans for Non-Essentials</h3>
            <p>Spring break trips, new laptops every year, eating out constantly—these add up.</p>
            <p>If it's not essential for your education, don't borrow for it.</p>

            <h3>3. Not Accounting for Refunds</h3>
            <p>If you got a refund last semester, you probably borrowed too much. Adjust this semester.</p>

            <h3>4. Ignoring Summer Costs</h3>
            <p>If you're not taking summer classes, you won't have loan money for summer living expenses. Plan ahead.</p>

            <h2>The 80% Rule</h2>
            <p>A good rule of thumb: <strong>Your total student loan debt at graduation should not exceed 80% of your expected first-year salary.</strong></p>

            <div class="callout warning">
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p>If you expect to earn $50,000/year after graduation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum recommended debt: $40,000</li>
                    <li>Over 8 semesters: ~$5,000 per semester</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you're borrowing more than that, you may struggle with repayment.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Subsidized vs Unsubsidized: Take Subsidized First</h2>
            <p>If you're offered both types of loans:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Always take subsidized loans first</strong> – The government pays your interest while you're in school</li>
                <li><strong>Only take unsubsidized if you need more</strong> – Interest accrues from day one</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Can You Reduce or Return Loans?</h2>

            <h3>Before Disbursement</h3>
            <p>You can reduce your loan amount anytime before it's disbursed. Contact your financial aid office.</p>

            <h3>After Disbursement</h3>
            <p>You can return all or part of your loan within <strong>120 days</strong> without paying interest.</p>
            <p>If you got a refund and realize you don't need it, return it immediately.</p>

            <h2>Tracking Your Total Debt</h2>
            <p>Don't wait until graduation to see your total. Track it every semester.</p>

            <h3>Use the National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS)</h3>
            <p>Visit <a href="https://studentaid.gov" target="_blank">StudentAid.gov</a> to see:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All your federal loans</li>
                <li>Current balances</li>
                <li>Interest rates</li>
                <li>Loan servicers</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Create a Semester-by-Semester Plan</h3>
            <p>Before each semester, ask:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How much have I borrowed so far?</li>
                <li>How much will I borrow this semester?</li>
                <li>What will my total be at graduation?</li>
                <li>Can I afford the monthly payment on that amount?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Alternatives to Borrowing More</h2>
            <p>If you're tempted to borrow more than you need, consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Get a part-time job</strong> – Even 10 hours/week helps</li>
                <li><strong>Apply for more scholarships</strong> – There are thousands of small scholarships available</li>
                <li><strong>Reduce expenses</strong> – Cheaper housing, cook instead of eating out, buy used textbooks</li>
                <li><strong>Take a lighter course load and work more</strong> – May take longer to graduate, but less debt</li>
            </ul>
