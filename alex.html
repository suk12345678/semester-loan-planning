    <div class="container">
        <h1>the semester-by-semester loan planning system</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">Here's the system I built after over-borrowing $15k freshman year. Data-driven, practical, and it actually works.</p>

        <div class="mistake-box">
            <p><strong>My $15,000 mistake:</strong> Freshman year, I borrowed the maximum amount offered "just in case." I didn't track my actual expenses. I didn't plan semester by semester. I just clicked "accept" on everything.</p>
            <p>By the end of freshman year, I had $15,000 more in loans than I actually needed. At 5% interest over 10 years, that's an extra $4,000 in interest. For money I didn't even use.</p>
            <p>I'm an economics major. I should have known better. But I didn't have a system. Now I do, and I'm sharing it.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>here's the system</h2>

        <p>This is the step-by-step process I use every semester to borrow exactly what I need - no more, no less.</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Calculate your actual costs (4-6 weeks before semester)</h3>

        <div class="system-box">
            <p><strong>Make a spreadsheet with these categories:</strong></p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Category</th>
                    <th>Amount</th>
                    <th>Notes</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Tuition</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Check your student account</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Fees</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Don't forget lab fees, rec center, etc.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Housing (semester total)</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Dorm or rent × months</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Meal plan / Food</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Be realistic, not optimistic</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Books & Supplies</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Check syllabi, buy used when possible</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Transportation</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Gas, parking, or flights home</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Personal / Misc</td>
                    <td>$_____</td>
                    <td>Toiletries, laundry, phone bill</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>TOTAL NEEDED</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>$_____</strong></td>
                    <td></td>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </div>

        <h3>Step 2: Calculate what you have (resources)</h3>

        <p>Now list every dollar you have available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Money in your bank account you can use</li>
            <li>Expected income from work-study or part-time job</li>
            <li>Scholarships or grants for this semester</li>
            <li>Family contribution (if any)</li>
            <li>Money from summer job</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="data-box">
            <p>TOTAL COSTS: $______</p>
            <p>MINUS RESOURCES: $______</p>
            <p>= AMOUNT TO BORROW: $______</p>
        </div>

        <p><span class="highlight">This is your target number.</span> Not the maximum offered. Not "just in case" money. Your actual gap.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Add a small buffer (but be strategic)</h3>

        <p>I learned this the hard way: you need SOME buffer for unexpected costs. But not $5,000. Here's my rule:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>If your gap is under $5,000: add $300-500 buffer</li>
            <li>If your gap is $5,000-$10,000: add $500-750 buffer</li>
            <li>If your gap is over $10,000: add $750-1,000 buffer</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This covers things like: textbook you didn't know about, medical copay, laptop charger dies, etc. But it's not "fun money" or "maybe I'll need it" money.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Only accept what you need</h3>

        <p>When you get your financial aid offer, you can accept LESS than the maximum. Here's how:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Log into your school's financial aid portal</li>
            <li>Find your loan offer (usually subsidized first, then unsubsidized)</li>
            <li>Click "modify" or "adjust" (every school's system is different)</li>
            <li>Enter your calculated amount instead of the maximum</li>
            <li>Accept only what you need</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="system-box">
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Accept subsidized loans first (no interest while in school), then unsubsidized only if you need more. Never accept PLUS loans unless you've exhausted everything else.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>the data that convinced me</h2>

        <p>I ran the numbers on my freshman year mistake. Here's what borrowing that extra $15,000 "just in case" actually cost me:</p>

        <div class="data-box">
            <p>Extra amount borrowed: $15,000</p>
            <p>Interest rate: 5.0%</p>
            <p>Repayment term: 10 years</p>
            <p>Monthly payment on that $15k: $159</p>
            <p>Total interest paid: $4,090</p>
            <p><strong>Total cost of "just in case": $19,090</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>That's $4,090 I'm paying in interest for money I didn't even need. Money that sat in my checking account earning 0.01% interest while accruing 5% interest in loans.</p>

        <p>Never again.</p>

        <h2>how this system saved me</h2>

        <p>Since implementing this system sophomore year:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fall 2022:</strong> Borrowed $7,200 instead of $10,500 offered (saved $3,300)</li>
            <li><strong>Spring 2023:</strong> Borrowed $6,800 instead of $10,500 offered (saved $3,700)</li>
            <li><strong>Fall 2023:</strong> Borrowed $8,100 instead of $10,500 offered (saved $2,400)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Total saved so far: <span class="highlight">$9,400 in unnecessary debt</span></p>

        <p>Over 10 years at 5% interest, that's about $3,000 in interest I won't have to pay. And I still have three more semesters to optimize.</p>

        <h2>common questions</h2>

        <h3>"What if I underestimate and need more money mid-semester?"</h3>

        <p>You can request additional loans mid-semester, but it's a hassle. That's why the buffer is important. But honestly? In two years of using this system, I've never needed to request more. The buffer has always been enough.</p>

        <h3>"What if I get a scholarship after I've already accepted loans?"</h3>

        <p>You can usually reduce your loan amount before disbursement. Contact your financial aid office. I did this spring semester when I got an unexpected $1,000 scholarship - reduced my loan by $1,000 the same day.</p>

        <h3>"Isn't it safer to just borrow extra?"</h3>

        <p>No. Here's why: every dollar you borrow costs you about $1.27 over 10 years (at 5% interest). So that $5,000 "safety net"? It actually costs you $6,350. That's not safety - that's expensive.</p>

        <p>A real safety net is: emergency fund in savings, part-time job, knowing you can request additional aid if truly needed.</p>

        <h2>the spreadsheet I actually use</h2>

        <p>I track everything in a Google Sheet with tabs for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Semester-by-semester cost projections</li>
            <li>Actual spending vs. projected (I review this monthly)</li>
            <li>Total loan balance tracker</li>
            <li>Interest calculations</li>
            <li>Post-graduation payment scenarios</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Is it nerdy? Yes. Does it work? Absolutely.</p>

        <div class="system-box">
            <p><strong>Tools I use:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Google Sheets for tracking (free, accessible anywhere)</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.itsyourincome.com" target="_blank">This loan calculator</a> for running scenarios (not affiliated, just useful)</li>
                <li>My school's financial aid portal (check it weekly during aid season)</li>
                <li>Mint or YNAB for actual spending tracking</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>my advice</h2>

        <p>Look, I know not everyone is a spreadsheet person. But you don't have to be. The core principle is simple:</p>

        <p><span class="highlight">Calculate what you actually need. Borrow that amount plus a small buffer. Nothing more.</span></p>

        <p>Every semester, before you accept your financial aid, spend 30 minutes doing the math. That's it. 30 minutes that could save you thousands of dollars.</p>

        <p>I wish I'd done this freshman year. I can't change that. But I can make sure I don't make the same mistake again, and I can help other students avoid it entirely.</p>

        <p>The system works. The data proves it. And your future self will thank you.</p>
